### Project: Evaluating Class Balance Using Entropy and Confusion Matrices

#### 1. **Introduction to Confusion Matrices**

In any classification task, evaluating the performance of a model is crucial for understanding how well it can differentiate between different classes. One of the most widely used evaluation metrics for classification models is the **confusion matrix**. 

A **confusion matrix** is a table used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm by showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. It provides a more detailed breakdown of model performance than just overall accuracy.

For example, consider a confusion matrix for a 3-class classification problem (with classes A, B, and C):

\[
CM = \begin{bmatrix}
0.65 & 0.15 & 0.20 \\
0.10 & 0.70 & 0.20 \\
0.15 & 0.10 & 0.75
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Here’s how to interpret it:
- The diagonal elements (0.65, 0.70, and 0.75) represent correct classifications (the number of times a class was predicted correctly).
- The off-diagonal elements represent misclassifications (the number of times a class was predicted incorrectly as another class).

For instance, the matrix shows that the model predicted class A as class B 15% of the time, and class A as class C 20% of the time.

#### 2. **Understanding Entropy in Classification**

**Entropy** is a concept from information theory that measures the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. It is widely used in various fields to quantify disorder or unpredictability.

In the context of a confusion matrix, entropy can be used to evaluate the **balance of misclassifications** between pairs of classes. The higher the entropy between two classes, the more "balanced" the confusion is between them, meaning the classifier is equally likely to misclassify one class as the other and vice versa. A lower entropy means the misclassifications are more one-sided, indicating a potential imbalance in training data or classifier performance.

#### 3. **Entropy Formula for Class Pairs**

To calculate the entropy between two classes, we use the following formula:

\[
e_{ij} = - \left[ \frac{C_{ij}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \ln\left(\frac{C_{ij}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}}\right) + \frac{C_{ji}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \ln\left(\frac{C_{ji}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}}\right) \right]
\]

Where:
- \( C_{ij} \) is the number of times class \( i \) was predicted as class \( j \).
- \( C_{ji} \) is the number of times class \( j \) was predicted as class \( i \).
- \( \ln \) represents the natural logarithm.

This formula calculates the entropy between two classes by considering the misclassifications between them. It calculates the probability of confusion in both directions (class \( i \) predicted as class \( j \), and class \( j \) predicted as class \( i \)) and computes the entropy based on those probabilities.

#### 4. **Problem Statement**

Given the confusion matrix below for a 3-class classification problem with classes A, B, and C:

\[
CM = \begin{bmatrix}
0.65 & 0.15 & 0.20 \\
0.10 & 0.70 & 0.20 \\
0.15 & 0.10 & 0.75
\end{bmatrix}
\]

You are tasked with the following:

1. **Write a Python function** to calculate the entropy for each pair of classes (A, B), (A, C), and (B, C) using the formula provided above.
   
2. **Compare the entropy values** for each class pair and determine which pair has the highest entropy. A higher entropy means more balanced misclassification, suggesting the classifier struggles equally between those two classes, possibly indicating sufficient training data for both classes.

3. **Interpret the results**. If a class pair has a higher entropy, what does that mean for the balance of misclassification and the sufficiency of training data?

#### 5. **Mathematical Representation**

Here is how we calculate the entropy between Class A and Class B:

\[
e_{AB} = - \left[ \frac{C_{AB}}{C_{AB} + C_{BA}} \ln\left(\frac{C_{AB}}{C_{AB} + C_{BA}}\right) + \frac{C_{BA}}{C_{AB} + C_{BA}} \ln\left(\frac{C_{BA}}{C_{AB} + C_{BA}}\right) \right]
\]

In the given confusion matrix:
- \( C_{AB} = 0.15 \) (Class A predicted as Class B)
- \( C_{BA} = 0.10 \) (Class B predicted as Class A)

The same process is repeated for the other class pairs (A, C) and (B, C).

#### 6. **Code Implementation**

Here is the Python code to calculate the entropy for the confusion matrix:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_entropy(CM):
    """
    Calculate the entropy for each pair of classes in the confusion matrix.
    
    Args:
    CM: np.array, confusion matrix
    
    Returns:
    entropy: float, calculated entropy for the given confusion matrix
    """
    N = CM.shape[0]  # Number of classes
    entropy = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            Cij = CM[i, j]
            Cji = CM[j, i]
            if (Cij + Cji) > 0:  # Avoid division by zero
                p_ij = Cij / (Cij + Cji)
                p_ji = Cji / (Cij + Cji)
                entropy += (p_ij * np.log(p_ij) + p_ji * np.log(p_ji))
    
    entropy = -entropy / (N * (N - 1) / 2)
    return entropy

# Confusion matrix
CM = np.array([[0.65, 0.15, 0.20],
               [0.10, 0.70, 0.20],
               [0.15, 0.10, 0.75]])

# Calculate entropy for pairs (A, B), (A, C), (B, C)
entropy_A_B = calculate_entropy(CM[:2, :2])
entropy_A_C = calculate_entropy(CM[np.ix_([0, 2], [0, 2])])
entropy_B_C = calculate_entropy(CM[1:, 1:])

# Print the results 
print(f"Entropy values for the given confusion matrix:")
print(f"- Entropy for pair (A, B): {entropy_A_B:.4f}")
print(f"- Entropy for pair (A, C): {entropy_A_C:.4f}")
print(f"- Entropy for pair (B, C): {entropy_B_C:.4f}")

# Highlight which pair has the highest entropy
highest_entropy_pair = max(
    ("(A, B)", entropy_A_B),
    ("(A, C)", entropy_A_C),
    ("(B, C)", entropy_B_C),
    key=lambda x: x[1]
)
print(f"\nThe pair with the highest entropy is {highest_entropy_pair[0]} with an entropy of {highest_entropy_pair[1]:.4f}, "
      "indicating it is more likely to have sufficient training data.")
```

#### 7. **Explanation of Code**

1. **Function `calculate_entropy`**:
   - This function takes in a confusion matrix and calculates the entropy for each pair of classes.
   - It iterates through each pair of classes, computes the probabilities of misclassification in both directions, and calculates the entropy based on those probabilities.
   - The entropy is normalized by dividing it by the total number of class pairs, ensuring that the result is representative of the overall class balance.

2. **Confusion Matrix (`CM`)**:
   - The confusion matrix is a 3x3 matrix representing the predictions and actual class labels.
   - For each pair of classes (A, B), (A, C), and (B, C), the code extracts the relevant elements from the matrix and calculates the entropy.

3. **Results**:
   - The entropies for each class pair are printed, and the pair with the highest entropy is identified.
   - Higher entropy indicates that the model is equally confused between the two classes, which may suggest that there is enough training data for both classes.

#### 8. **Conclusion**

- This project demonstrates how **entropy** can be used to evaluate the **balance of misclassifications** in a classification problem.
- By identifying the class pairs with the highest entropy, you can assess which class pairs are more likely to have **sufficient training data**.
- This method provides insight into the **performance of the classifier** and highlights areas where the model may need improvement, such as class pairs with lower entropy (indicating imbalanced misclassification).
