1. General Information
In machine learning classification tasks, a confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of a model. It shows the actual class labels vs. the predicted labels, helping to determine how well a model can distinguish between different classes.

Entropy, a concept from information theory, measures uncertainty or disorder. In the context of a confusion matrix, entropy quantifies how balanced the misclassifications are between pairs of classes. Higher entropy indicates more balanced misclassification between classes, which often suggests that the model has sufficient training data for both classes.
## 2. Mathematical Formula and Explanation

The entropy between two classes `i` and `j` based on their misclassifications in a confusion matrix is calculated using the following formula:

$$
e_{ij} = - \left[ \frac{C_{ij}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \ln \left( \frac{C_{ij}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \right) + \frac{C_{ji}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \ln \left( \frac{C_{ji}}{C_{ij} + C_{ji}} \right) \right]
$$

Where:

- $$\( C_{ij} \)$$ is the number of times class $$\( i \)$$ was predicted as class $$\( j \)$$ (misclassification).
- $$\( C_{ji} \)$$ is the number of times class $$\( j \)$$ was predicted as class $$\( i \)$$.
- The natural logarithm $$(\(\ln\))$$ is applied to these probabilities.

The entropy formula calculates the degree of uncertainty in the model's confusion between two classes. Higher entropy implies that the model is equally likely to confuse the two classes, indicating a balanced dataset for those classes.
